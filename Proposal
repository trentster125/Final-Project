# Proposal

Summary:
  For my project I have decided to modify a low poly style sheet metal chair that I built. I will be making the chair into an interactive sound machine. The many different faces of the form will each be turned into a pad that will play a unique sound. i will lay copper over the different faces and turn each one into a separate capacitive sensor.  One of the faces will act as a switch that will activate a different set of tones. The piece will essentially be a large interactive beat pad.

Component Parts:

Chair - Already made.
Copper Foil - To be purchased.
Arduino Uno - Already acquired.
Arduino SD Extension - Will check out for project.
Wiring - To be purchased.
Speaker - Already acquired.
100k resistor
1k resistor
insulator like tape or something- will purchase


Challenges:

I think one of the difficulties I will run into will be adjusting the sensitivity and delay of the pads to the right levels. I think it will also difficult for me to write the code that will make the tones switch to a new set. Getting the sheets of copper to fit the shapes and laying down the insulator will be time consuming.

Project Timeline:

Week 1 - Do finishing grind work on chair. Cut access door into existing metal bottom and weld shelf for electronics.

Week 2 -  Attach copper and drill holes for wires to feed from copper into the chair. 

Week 3 - Perform capacitive sensor tests specifically testing how well it works over a widespread area. Write code and prepare sound files.

Week 4 - Assemble and fine tune.
